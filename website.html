						<h1 style="color: rgb(252, 9, 9);" r" align="center">| INFORMATION ABOUT HOCKEY |</h1>
						<p> Hockey is a term used to denote a family of various types of both summer and winter team
							sports
							which originated on either an outdoor field, sheet of ice, or dry floor such as in a
							gymnasium.
							While these sports vary in specific rules, numbers of players, apparel and, notably, playing
							surface, they share broad characteristics of two opposing teams using a stick to propel a
							ball or
							disk into a goal.There are many types of hockey. Some games make the use of skates, either
							wheeled, or bladed while
							others do not. In order to help make the distinction between these various games, the word
							"hockey"
							is often preceded by another word i.e. "field hockey", "ice hockey", "roller hockey", "rink
							hockey",
							or "floor hockey".In each of these sports, two teams play against each other by trying to
							manoeuvre the object of
							play, either a type of ball or a disk (such as a puck), into the opponent's goal using a
							hockey
							stick. Two notable exceptions use a straight stick and an open disk (still referred to as a
							"puck")
							with a hole in the center instead. The first case is a style of floor hockey whose rules
							were
							codified in 1936 during the Great Depression by Canada's Sam Jacks. The second case involves
							a
							variant which was later modified in roughly the 1970s to make a related game that would be
							considered suitable for inclusion as a team sport in the newly emerging Special Olympics.
							The floor
							game of gym ringette, though related to floor hockey, is not a true variant due to the fact
							that it
							was designed in the 1990s and modelled off of the Canadian ice skating team sport of
							ringette, which
							was invented in Canada in 1963. Ringette was also invented by Sam Jacks, the same Canadian
							who
							codified the rules for the open disk style of floor hockey 1936.Certain sports which share
							general characteristics with the forms of hockey, but are not generally
							referred to as hockey include Lacrosse, Hurling, Camogie and Shinty.

					<p>Games played with curved sticks and a ball can be found in the histories of many cultures. In
						Egypt,
						4000-year-old carvings feature teams with sticks and a projectile, hurling dates to before 1272
						BC
						in Ireland, and there is a depiction from approximately 600 BC in Ancient Greece, where the game
						may
						have been called kerētízein because it was played with a horn or horn-like stick In Inner
						Mongolia,
						the Daur people have been playing beikou, a game similar to modern field hockey, for about 1,000
						years.

						Most evidence of hockey-like games during the Middle Ages is found in legislation concerning
						sports
						and games. The Galway Statute enacted in Ireland in 1527 banned certain types of ball games,
						including games using "hooked" (written "hockie", similar to "hooky") sticks.

						...at no tyme to use ne occupye the horlinge of the litill balle with hockie stickes or staves,
						nor
						use no hande ball to play withoute walles, but only greate foote balle[13]

						"Bandy, . a game, like that of Golf, in which the ad- verse parties endeavour to beat a ball
						(generally a knob or gnarl from the trunk of a tree,) opposite ways...the stick with which the
						game
						is played is crook'd at the end;." [1] mid C18th Devon.

						By the 19th century, the various forms and divisions of historic games began to differentiate
						and
						coalesce into the individual sports defined today. Organizations dedicated to the codification
						of
						rules and regulations began to form, and national and international bodies sprang up to manage
						domestic and international competition.

				</div>
				<br></br>
				<p align="left"> 1) Hockey players can only hit the ball with the flat side of their stick.
				</p>
				<p align="left"> 2) Hockey players (other than the goalkeeper) are not allowed to use their feet, or any
					other parts of the body, to control the ball at any time.
				</p>
				<p align="left"> 3) A goal can only be scored either from a field goal, a penalty corner, or from a
					penalty stroke. A field goal is a goal scored from open play, and can only be scored from inside the
					'striking circle', in front of the opponent's goal. If the hockey ball is hit from outside the
					circle and goes into the goal, it does not count as a goal.
				</p>
				<p align="left"> 4) Hockey players may not trip, push, charge, interfere with, or physically handle an
					opponent in any way. Hockey is a non-contact sport and all fouls result in a free hit or a 'penalty
					corner' for the non-offending team depending on where the infringement took place and the severity
					of the foul.

					<h1 align="center">| Equipment |</h1>
				</div><img src="equipment.jpg" width="100%" height="500px" align="center">
				< <p>Hockey stick and ball are the most important equipment without which the sport cannot be played.
					There are many other equipment like shin guard, helmet, glove, shoes, etc., that a hockey player
					uses during the match.</p>

					<p>The following are the equipment used in the hockey game by the goalie and the players.</p>

					<p>Hockey Stick -It is a wooden stick with length varying from 26"to 38.5"depending on height of the
						player. The bat has a hooked shape at the head. There are mostly four types of variations namely
						shorti, midi, maxi and the J Hook depending on the efficiency of the player holding the ball.
						The shorti type is used by players, who take an extreme control over the ball to increase the
						manoeuvrability. Generally, the players at the mid field position use this type of bat in the
						game.
					</p>

					<p>The midi type is used by the players who hit the ball more often and need to be strong on the
						reverse
						side. Strikers use midi predominantly.</p>

					<p>The maxi type is used by the players who act as defenders or attackers. This bat is similar to
						the
						midi type but the surface area is being increased. For stopping the ball, its strength allows it
						to
						be much more efficient in doing that.</p>

					<p>The J Hook type has a much larger surface area. However, it doesn't possess the efficiency of the
						midi type in striking the ball. But, for stopping the ball it has an increased thickness. This
						head
						type is preferred by the defenders.</p>

					<p>Ball- The hockey ball is a plastic spherical shaped material made of cork core usually white
						colored.
						The color varies based on the color of the ground on which the game is played. The circumference
						of
						the ball is generally 224 to 235mm. It weighs around 156 to 163gms. To reduce aquaplaning, the
						ball
						is covered with indentations so that on wet grounds the inconsistent ball speed cannot occur.
					</p>

					<p>Shin guards - It is worn in front of a player's shin for protection from injury.</p>

					<p>Mouth guards - It is to protect the mouth and teeth during the game while playing.</p>

					<p>Helmet and throat protector - These equipment are used to protect head and throat from getting
						injured.</p>

					<p>Cleats (Shoes) - There are special types of shoes which enhance the free walk and run over the
						ground.</p>

					<p>Goggles, Gloves, Head bands - Goggles and gloves are used by the goalies whereas; head bands are
						used
						by the players except the goal keepers.</p>

					<p>Goalie sticks and heads - For hitting the ball and striking it, the goal keepers use a different
						type
						of bat.</p>

					<p>Face Mask - It is one of the latest equipment in hockey. It exposes only the eyes and covers rest
						of
						the face. Again, this is also made of fiber. It has elastic band or belt to fit firmly.</p>

					<p>Body Pad or Chest Protector -The body pad covers the ribs from getting hurt. This is worn inside
						the
						uniform.</p>

					<p>Pads -The pads are worn to protect knees and lower part of limbs.</p>

					<p>Kicker -Kicker is a unique show used by goalkeepers. They are strong enough to protect the toes
						when
						goalkeeper tries to kick or block the ball to prevent goal.</p>

					<p>These are the equipment used for playing hockey and most of the equipment are used by the
						goalkeepers. The goalkeeper is given much protection in comparison to other players as they have
						to
						move continuously and weight of the equipment may slow down their movement</p>
